Flash Freeze
============

Utilities to rapidly archive particular web pages and their dependencies.

 * NOTE that Ghost.py should work better, in that it is support to support NSPlugins like Flash, Java, etc. However, this isn't working on my OSX PySide install, so may be worth following up with a full PyQt install and/or using a Linux box.
 * Using PyQT instead on OS X made no difference.
